Hello 

I just want to say that I am just learning a little bit of github and how it works.
Plus I am a novice programmer and a novice game designer/developer. I am not working
at industry level instead most of it will be worked on whenever I have time off from
work and school. however I am looking forward to practice coding on github whenever I 
have a chance to go online.
